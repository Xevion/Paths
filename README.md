# Paths

Paths is a Unity-based application dedicated to showing off a array of different pathfinding algorithms in a variety of different environments and configurations.

## Development Cycle

While Paths is intended to be a fully functional project ready for anyone, it is also a project of personal interest and a resume item.

If it interests you, you can see [here](./CYCLE.md) a link to my development cycle in the form of documented screenshots as I went from nothing to something. I attempted to add descriptions showing off precisely what I did.
